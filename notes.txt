IDENTIFYING / NON-IDENTIFYING RELATIONSHIP
The terms identifying relationship and non-identifying relationship refer to how the primary key
of the table on the many side is supposed to be constructed. The theory is that for identifying
relationships, the primary key of the one table cascades down to the many table, and is concatenated
to the identifier of the many table to form the primary key. Many CASE tools that you can use to
draw ERDs implement this theory as a rule that you can't easily circumvent.

The non-identifying relationship doesn't have a restriction about cascading the primary key.
Each table has its own unique identifier; neither table inherits part of its primary key from the other.
